# Line-Following-Robot-using-Arduino-Uno
Line follower is an intelligent robot which detects the visual line embedded on the floor and follows it. The path is predefined and is visible like a black line on the white surface or white line on the black surface.

Robot Specifications

•	The robot is fully automated that it follows a particular line to move on the surface. 

•	Infrared sensors are employed in the robot to detect the line on the surface that is black line on the white surface.

•	Another IR sensor is fitted on the either side of robot this can be used to stop the robot at a particular place in between the path.

•	Arduino Uno interface is used for the combination of hardware and software and code written in arduino helps to control the movement of the wheels.

•	 DC gear motor is used to drive the wheels and 5V power supply is provided to run the robot.
